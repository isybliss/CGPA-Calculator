# CGPA Calculator

The CGPA Calculator is a web application built using Python and Flask framework that allows students to calculate their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on their course grades and credit units. It provides a user-friendly interface for students to manage their academic information and track their academic progress.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.3.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their name, email address, and password.

- User Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their email and password.

- Dashboard: After logging in, users are presented with a dashboard that displays their personal information, academic details, and navigation links to different sections.

- Course Management: Users can add, edit, and delete courses. Each course entry includes information such as course code, title, credit units, and grade.

- Grade Calculation: The application calculates the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on the provided course grades and credit units. It also calculates the CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) based on the user's previous CGPA and current GPA, taking into account the admission mode (UTME or DE) and academic level.

- Visualization: The application provides a graphical representation of the user's grade trend over time, allowing them to visualize their academic progress.

- Account Settings: Users have the option to change their password, delete their account, and log out.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
